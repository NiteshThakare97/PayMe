                            <h4>Acceptance</h4>
                            <p>By registering on, accessing, browsing, downloading, or using the Payme Platform for any general purpose or for the specific purpose of availing of any Payme Service, you agree to be bound by the single-sign-on ID (hereinafter SSOID) terms and conditions set forth below as well as by the service-specific terms and conditions applicable to each Payme Service (hereinafter collectively, the T&Cs). These T&Cs shall also include any additional or modified terms and conditions in relation to the SSOID or any additional or modified service-specific terms and conditions in relation to any Payme Service or any future service that may be offered by Payme on the Payme Platform. By registering on, accessing, browsing, downloading, or using (as applicable) the Payme Platform or availing of any Payme service or the SSOID, you automatically and immediately agree to all the T&Cs. If at any time you do not accept or agree with any of the T&Cs or do not wish to be bound by the T&Cs, you may not access, browse, or use the Payme Platform and immediately terminate your use of the Payme Services. Accepting or agreeing to the T&Cs will constitute a legal contract (hereinafter an agreement) between you, being at least 18 years of age and an individual user of the Payme Platform or a customer or beneficiary of the Payme Services, and Payme. All services are rendered by Payme through the Payme Platform under the brand name “Payme” (or any derivatives or variations thereof). Consequently, all the rights, benefits, liabilities, and obligations under the T&Cs shall, as the case may be, accrue to the benefit of, or be incurred by, Payme regarding your use of Payme’s digital services (which include but are not limited to prepaid recharge, bill payment, booking movie tickets, bus tickets, hotel rooms, or flight tickets), the semi-closed wallet service, the marketplace service, or any such other services that may be added to the Payme Platform and which will henceforth be a Payme Service from time to time. The Payme services shall be used by you, subject to your adherence to the T&Cs. As long as you accept and comply with these T&Cs, Payme grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited, and revocable privilege to enter and use the Payme Platform and/or avail of the Payme Services.</p>
                            <h4>Eligibility</h4>
                            <p>The Payme Services are not available to persons under the age of 18 or to anyone previously suspended or removed by Payme from availing of the Payme Services or accessing the Payme Platform. By accepting the T&Cs or otherwise using the Payme Services on the Payme Platform, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age and have not been previously suspended or removed by Payme, or disqualified for any other reason, from availing of the Payme Services or using the Payme Platform. In addition, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this agreement and to abide by all the T&Cs as part of this agreement. Finally, you shall not impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your identity, age, or affiliation with any person or entity. Finally, in the event of any violation of the T&Cs, Payme reserves the right to suspend or permanently prevent you from availing of Payme services or using the Payme platform.</p>
                            <h4> Other Terms and Conditions</h4>
                            <p>Additional terms and conditions may apply in order for you to avail of specific Payme services and specific portions or features of the Payme platform, including contests, promotions, or other similar features, all of which terms are made a part of these T&Cs by this reference. You agree to abide by such other terms and conditions, including, where applicable, that you are of sufficient legal age to use or participate in such a service or feature. If there is a conflict between these T&Cs and the terms posted for or applicable to a specific portion of the Payme Platform or for any Payme Service offered on or through the Payme Platform, the latter terms shall control with respect to your use of that portion of the Payme Platform or the specific Payme Service. Payme may make changes to any Payme Services offered on the Payme Platform or to the applicable terms for any such Payme Services at any time, without notice. The materials on the Payme Platform with respect to the Payme Services may be out of date, and Payme makes no commitment to update the materials on the Payme Platform with respect to such Payme Services.</p>
                            <h4>SSOID Service, Participating Platforms</h4>
                            <p> Payme’s SSOID service offers you the convenience, after a one-time registration on any Payme platform, to sign on (log in) to all web pages and online platforms operated by Payme or its affiliates (hereinafter the Participating Platforms) with single log-in access and data without going through a separate registration process every time. After successfully registering for the SSOID service, the user can log in via each participating platform with his SSOID access credentials. Moreover, if already logged in to one of the participating platforms, the user can immediately use all other participating platforms without additional log-in procedures (subject to the respective participating platform requiring further declarations). The participating platforms that offer the SSOID as a login feature are visible on registration and in the user account. The number of participating platforms may also vary over the course of time. With regard to the contractual relationships of the users with the respective participating platforms, for the purposes of which Payme’s SSOID service is or can be used in accordance with these T&Cs, these can alternatively have their own commercial and user terms and conditions. These business or user terms and conditions are available on the respective participating platforms. For the respective contents of the participating platforms, the respective affiliate of Payme is solely responsible for the content that it actually operates. For the SSOID service, these T&Cs apply exclusively, whereas for the use of the participating platforms, their business and user terms and conditions apply along with these T&Cs. The SSOID shall be owned and operated by One97 for use on all participating platforms. For the use of Payme’s SSOID service, the user must register. Registration as a user is only allowed if the user meets the eligibility criteria as set out in these T&Cs. Each user can set up only one user account. The user is obliged to provide correct and complete information during registration and use of the SSOID service. The login data is intended solely for personal use by the user and is therefore always to be kept secret and safe. The user is not entitled to share his login details with third parties to use the SSOID service or to disclose them otherwise. The user is obliged to inform Payme immediately upon becoming aware of and/or suspecting a case of any unauthorized use, disclosure, and/or misuse of their access data or of their user account. Furthermore, the user is obliged not to use the user account of another person. Submission of the duly completed registration form by the user simply provides an invitation to us to make an offer to enter into an agreement on the use of our SSOID service (hereinafter the SSOID Agreement). Our offer for the conclusion of the SSOID Agreement is then affected by the fact that Payme sends the user a confirmation by email, in which a confirmation link is included next to the user’s name and the password for the SSOID Service. By clicking on this confirmation link, the user accepts Payme’s offer, so in this way, the SSOID Agreement enters into force. Conclusion of the SSOID Agreement may also be affected through other communication modes and following such processes, which help achieve the same purpose as the aforementioned email confirmation process. Payme is entitled to reject individual users without giving reasons. The user guarantees that the data submitted for their user account (and any other information that is otherwise left for Payme) is, in all respects, complete, true, accurate, and not misleading. Any changes to the user's data should be promptly updated correctly in their account.
